-- Singular dbt test: passes when this query returns zero rows (severity: error).
-- Project rule: money amounts have at most 2 decimals, like real currencies.
-- It checks every layer that holds a money amount:
--   seeds     raw_payments.amount is in CENTS, so it must be a whole number (0 decimals).
--             A fractional cent here would become more than 2 decimals once converted to dollars.
--   staging   stg_payments.amount is in dollars (2 decimals).
--   marts     customers and orders amounts are in dollars (2 decimals).
-- A row is returned for every amount whose value changes when rounded to its allowed decimals.
-- The tiny tolerance (1e-9) only absorbs floating point storage noise on DOUBLE columns.
-- When you add a new amount column to any layer, add it below.
